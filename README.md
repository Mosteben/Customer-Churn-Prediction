# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Summary
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using a dataset that includes various customer attributes. The dataset features attributes such as customer ID, gender, senior citizen status, tenure, and service types. The primary objective is to preprocess the data, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build a predictive model using logistic regression. The model's performance will be evaluated to gain insights into customer behavior and improve retention strategies.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Investigates the relationship between customer features and churn.
- **Model Implementation**: Utilizes logistic regression for churn prediction.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow.
